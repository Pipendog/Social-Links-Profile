## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

css properties: Learn how to center divs in the mwiddle of the pages

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  background-color: black;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This helped me search for elements that best suit my page.
- [Layout with Flexbox](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-intermediate-css/modules/layout-with-flexbox/cheatsheet) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the proper layout with flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
